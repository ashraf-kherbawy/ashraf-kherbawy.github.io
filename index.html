							<h2>Get in touch</h2>
							<p>Address munging is the practice of disguising an e-mail address to prevent it from being automatically collected by unsolicited bulk e-mail providers. 
							An email address such as, "no-one@example.com", becomes "no-one at example dot com", for instance.</p>
							<p>Thus, you can reach out to me at: ashraf dot kh99 at protonmail dot com</p>
